# [Proto16](https://github.com/kaadmy/proto16) (aka **P16**) v0.1.0

A 16-bit fantasy console.

# Jam

**Currently unfinished, latest possible deadline is Nov 30, 2017**

Made within 14 days for a fantasy console development jam.

Development time:

- Nov 6, 2017 (Documentation)
- Nov 7, 2017 (Documentation/code)
- Nov 11, 2017 (Documentation)

Note: When the jam is over, I'll probably fork Proto16 into Proto32 as a 32-bit console more akin to 5th gen consoles such as the N64 and PS1.
